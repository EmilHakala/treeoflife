	“Among Pale Limbs” is a horror/surrealistic story-driven roguelite, where you have to defend a sacred tree with the blood of your enemies.

Concept
Gameplay overview
When it is day in-game, the player must defend a tree from enemies using weapons and tools bought from NPCs with loot that the player has scavenged through exploration. At night, the player goes into the wilderness to uncover the truth about the enemies and the tree.

Art
Design
Heavily inspired by games like “Ultrakill” and older PS1 games, but with its own twist. Low quality with effects like dithering present. 


Audio
Music
To add to the fast-paced nature of fighting, jungle/breakbeat music will be playing when it’s day in-game. At night, when the player goes out, ambient and slower music will be playing.
Sound Effects
Sound effects will generally be digital and made with synthesizers to add to the game's theme. 


Game Experience

R - Reload
SPACEBAR - Jump
